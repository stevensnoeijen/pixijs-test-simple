Hi.

Thanks for making some time to make this assignment for us. I promise it won't be too hard, and won't take too much of your time. This assignment is meant for us to get a small peek into how you work, how you structure and document your code, and to see how you solve problems.

For the assignment, we would like you to create a simple interactive demo in Typescript, featuring [Pixi.js](https://www.pinclipart.com/picdir/middle/526-5261120_mario-sprite-super-mario-world-clipart.png). Within this repository is a simple Pixi.js starter template. The goal is to display a character on the screen that we can move around by using the `W, A, S, D` buttons on the keyboard.

## Setup

To set it up, clone the repository and  install the necessary dependencies by running either `npm install` or `yarn`. Afterwards, run the development server by running `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`. This will spin up [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to give you a development environment to work in. There's an image of Mario that will be served for you on `URL/mario.png`

## The assignment

### Requirements

- Display a sprite of the image of Mario and add it to the scene.
- Scale the image of Mario down 50%.
- Allow for the user to move Mario by using the **W** button to move up, the **A** button to move left, the **S** button to move down, and the **D** button to move right.

### Nice to haves

- Flip the image of Mario horizontally when moving to the left. 
- Implement "sprinting" (Allow Mario to move faster while the **Shift** key is pressed).
